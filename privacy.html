      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 11, 2026</p>

      <p><strong>MemoruSha Academy</strong> ("we", "our", "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information and user
  data.</p>

      <h3>1. Target Audience (Age Restriction)</h3>
      <p>This service is intended for users aged <strong>13 and older</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware
  that we have inadvertently collected such data, we will take steps to delete it.</p>

      <h3>2. Data Collection & Storage</h3>
      <p>The app does not collect, store, or transmit your personal data (such as name, email, or photos) to our servers. All training progress, preferences, and settings
  are stored locally on your device.</p>

      <h3>3. Third-Party Services & Ads (AdMob)</h3>
      <p>We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads. AdMob may collect and process limited data based on your consent, including:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Advertising ID (GAID)</li>
          <li>Device information (model, OS, network)</li>
          <li>Approximate location (based on IP)</li>
          <li>Ad interactions (impressions, clicks)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. User Consent (GDPR/UK/EEA)</h3>
      <p>For users in regulated regions (EEA, UK), we use a Consent Management Platform (CMP). You will be asked for permission before personalized ads are shown.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>If you consent:</strong> Google may use your Advertising ID to show relevant (personalized) ads.</li>
          <li><strong>If you decline:</strong> You will still see ads, but they may be less relevant (non-personalized). Your Advertising ID will not be used for
  personalization.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can change or withdraw your consent at any time in the app settings.</p>

      <h3>5. Data Sharing</h3>
      <p>We do not sell personal information. We do not sell or share personal data under CCPA/CPRA.</p>
      <p>We may share limited data with service providers (such as AdMob) to deliver and measure ads. Advertising identifiers (AD_ID) may be processed by ad service
  providers for advertising and measurement.</p>

      <h3>6. Permissions</h3>
      <p>The app uses the following permission to function compliantly:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Advertising ID Permission (com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID):</strong> Used by Google AdMob for advertising and measurement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Security</h3>
      <p>We prioritize the security of your local data. Since we do not transmit your personal training data to any cloud server, your progress remains solely on your
  device. Please note that no electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

      <h3>8. International Use</h3>
      <p>The app is available globally. We do not transmit or store user data on our servers. Ad providers may process data in different regions for ad delivery and
  measurement.</p>

      <h3>9. Your Rights (CCPA/GDPR)</h3>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete your data and to withdraw consent for personalized ads. Since we do not store user
  data on external servers, please contact the third-party service provider (Google) for ad-related requests, or use device/app options to reset local data.</p>
